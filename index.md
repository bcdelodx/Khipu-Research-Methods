Most economic models treat culture as a residual and equity as an afterthought. Policy questions don't respect those boundaries.

KRL frameworks bridge the gap between macroeconomic consistency and the heterogeneous experiences of diverse populations. We build computational infrastructure for research programs that need to model complex systems without false precision—and measure distributional impacts without losing analytical rigor.

Each framework below includes an IMRAD-structured summary and full technical documentation available for download.
