## Available Frameworks

<div class="row">
    <div class="12u">
        <h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2026/01/22/cge_abm_framework.html">CGE-ABM Framework for Cultural-Economic Systems</a></h3>
        <p><strong>Status:</strong> In Development | <strong>Validation Target:</strong> Q4 2026 - Q1 2027</p>
        <p>
            A multi-scale approach integrating Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) with Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)
            for equity analysis. Models cultural trait evolution, media influence on behavior, and distributional
            impacts of policy interventions.
