# CGE–ABM Equity Research Archive

This repository hosts a living research archive focused on methods-forward economic modeling at the intersection of
macroeconomic equilibrium, agent-based simulation, cultural systems, and distributional equity.

The site is published via GitHub Pages using the Forty Jekyll theme and serves as a canonical, link-stable reference
for papers, technical notes, and works-in-progress released over time.

## Purpose and Scope

The materials published here are architectural rather than predictive. They are designed to:
- Explore structural integrations between CGE models and agent-based models (ABMs)
- Examine how cultural, behavioral, and institutional heterogeneity can be represented without false precision
- Provide transparent assumptions, bounded claims, and explicit validation status

This is not a product site, marketing blog, or forecasting platform. It is a research surface intended for critical
engagement by economists, computational social scientists, policy analysts, and related practitioners.

## Publication Model

Content is released incrementally and may include:
- Full research papers (versioned and citable)
- Shorter methodological notes and framing essays
- Clarifications, revisions, or boundary-setting updates to prior work

Earlier papers may be revised, superseded, or explicitly constrained as assumptions change or new evidence emerges.

## Use and Citation

All content is intended for research, policy exploration, and scholarly discussion.
Citation guidance and version histories are provided within individual papers.

Nothing in this repository should be interpreted as policy advice, regulatory guidance, or predictive economic output.
