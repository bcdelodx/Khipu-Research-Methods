## About Khipu Research Labs

Khipu Research Labs (KRL) is a research organization dedicated to developing computational frameworks for understanding the intersection of economic systems, cultural dynamics, and social equity. Our work addresses a critical gap in policy analysis: the need for tools that can simultaneously model macroeconomic conditions and the heterogeneous experiences of diverse populations.

### Our Mission

To create rigorous, transparent, and accessible research tools that support equitable policy deliberation. We believe that:

- **Complexity can be modeled** without false precision or overconfident predictions
- **Equity must be central**, not an afterthought in economic analysis
- **Culture matters** as a dynamic system variable, not a residual category
- **Transparency is non-negotiable** in research that may influence policy

### Research Focus

Our frameworks integrate multiple methodological traditions:

- **Computable General Equilibrium (CGE)** models for economy-wide consistency
- **Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)** for population heterogeneity and emergent dynamics
- **Network Analysis** for social influence and information diffusion
- **Distributional Analysis** for equity measurement and decomposition

## About Khipu Research Methods

This GitHub Pages site serves as the **source of truth** for KRL framework documentation. It is designed to:

### Provide Accessible Summaries

Each framework is presented as an IMRAD-structured summary (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) that communicates key concepts without requiring deep technical expertise. These summaries serve as entry points for:

- Policymakers assessing analytical tools
- Researchers exploring collaboration opportunities
- Students learning multi-scale modeling approaches
- Practitioners evaluating framework applicability

### Enable Full Documentation Access

Complete technical whitepapers are available for registered users. These comprehensive documents include:

- Detailed mathematical specifications
- Data source documentation and bias audits
- Implementation guidance and code references
- Validation protocols and status tracking
- Governance frameworks and terms of use

### Track Framework Evolution

Research is iterative. This archive tracks:

- Version histories and change logs
- Validation status updates
- Known limitations and ongoing improvements
- Community feedback and response

## The Name "Khipu"

A khipu (also spelled quipu) was a recording device used by the Inca civilization and earlier Andean cultures. Made of colored, spun, and plied cords with numeric and other values encoded by knots, khipus served as tools for administration, census-taking, and storytelling.

We adopted this name because it represents:

- **Encoding complexity** in structured, interpretable forms
- **Integration of quantitative and qualitative** information
- **Cultural specificity** in tools that serve particular communities and purposes
- **Legacy of innovation** in civilizations often excluded from Western-centric narratives

Our frameworks aspire to similar goals: encoding complex social and economic realities in ways that support understanding and decision-making while respecting the cultural contexts in which they operate.
